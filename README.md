================
The run_analysis.R script attempts to do pretty much everything
for you... it checks for and creates a "Data" directory in your working 
directory, and checks for the existance of the files before 
downloading/extracting them.

Therefore, if this is being run for the first time, ensure you 
don't have the following:
[Working Dir]/Data/UCI HAR Dataset/
[Working Dir]/Data/smartphones.zip
[Working Dir]/Data/CourseProject.txt

Or the script will assume it has generated these already.
